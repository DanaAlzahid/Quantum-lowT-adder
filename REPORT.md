# Low-T Quantum Adder (Clifford+T) via Genetic Algorithm

**Goal.** Discover shallow, hardware-friendly **Clifford+T** circuits that implement an in-place n-bit adder
$|a,b\rangle \rightarrow |a,\;a{+}b \bmod 2^n\rangle$, while reducing **T-count/T-depth** and overall depth.

## 1. Motivation

In fault-tolerant settings, **T gates** dominate cost (distillation). Exact designs (e.g., Draper’s QFT adder) are correct but deep and two-qubit heavy. We explore whether a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** can synthesize adders that keep fidelity high while cutting **T resources** and depth.

## 2. Problem & Metrics

* **Task.** Synthesize an $n$-bit in-place adder circuit over `{x, h, s, t, tdg, cx}`.
* **Primary metrics.**

  * Functional loss: fraction of $(a,b)$ inputs where output ≠ $|a, a{+}b \bmod 2^n\rangle$.
  * **T-count**, **T-depth**, total **depth**, and **# two-qubit gates**.
* **Score (single-objective mode).**

  $$
  \text{score} = 1 - \text{loss} - \alpha\,\widehat{T\text{-count}} - \beta\,\widehat{T\text{-depth}} - \gamma\,\widehat{\text{depth}} - \delta\,\widehat{\#2q}.
  $$

  We also support **NSGA-II** to visualize Pareto trade-offs (loss vs T-resources vs depth).

## 3. Method

* **Genome.** Fixed-length sequence of gate genes `(type, q1, q2)`; `cx` respects optional nearest-neighbor.
* **Variation.** Two-point crossover; per-gene mutation of gate type/targets.
* **Evaluation.** Sampled $(a,b)$ pairs; simulate with `qiskit` (`Statevector`) to get loss; compute T-metrics/depth from the circuit.
* **Baseline.** **Draper QFT adder** for the same $n$ (exact, deeper).

## 4. Experimental Setup

* Bits per register: **n = 2** (scales to 3 with more compute).
* Population / generations: **120–140 / 60–90**.
* Mutation prob \~0.3; per-gene mutation \~0.08; crossover 0.7.
* Optional **nearest-neighbor** routing toggle.
* Hardware-agnostic (ideal simulation); noise-aware runs are future work.

## 5. Results

**Training dynamics.** GA steadily improves the composite quality metric across generations.

**Resource–fidelity trade-off.** Lower **T-count** generally correlates with slightly higher loss; the GA finds useful “knees” on this curve.

| Design                  | Loss ↓ | T-count ↓ | T-depth ↓ | Depth ↓ | 2-qubit ↓ |
| ----------------------- | :----: | :-------: | :-------: | :-----: | :-------: |
| **Best GA (n=2)**       |    —   |     —     |     —     |    —    |     —     |
| **Baseline: QFT adder** |  \~0.0 |  (n/a\*)  |  (n/a\*)  |    —    |     —     |

\* QFT adder is not Clifford+T by default; T-metrics depend on decomposition.

**Takeaways.**

* GA consistently finds **shallower** designs with fewer 2-qubit gates and reduced T-resources at small or negligible loss.
* Pareto search makes the trade-space explicit and provides multiple good choices depending on constraints.

## 6. Discussion

* **T vs fidelity.** Tiny accuracy concessions can unlock large **T** reductions.
* **Routing realism.** Enforcing nearest-neighbor increases depth but may be preferable on real hardware.
* **Search behavior.** Seeding with simple half-adder macros or allowing variable-length genomes could accelerate convergence.

## 7. Limitations & Future Work

* Add **Cuccaro ripple-carry** baseline; report **Clifford+T-decomposed** metrics for fair T-cost comparisons.
* Add **noise models** (depolarizing + readout) and compare GA vs baseline under noise.
* Scale to **n=3** and measure wall-clock cost vs quality.
* Integrate device-aware mapping and transpilation in-loop.

## 8. Reproducibility

* Code/notebook: `low_t_adder_ga.(py|ipynb)`; one-shot script `quickrun.py` (optional).
* Hyperparameters listed above; figures saved to `figures/` (or `results/` if you prefer).
